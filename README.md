# ProgressiveOverload

## To Do

This is the current, simple requirements that needs to be dealt on the backend.

* Add a few types of workouts (and allow users to create some)
* Keep a history of previous workout sets
* Create new workout sets (Allow the adding any workout in it) and give it names
* Show workout set trends.

Then...

* GUI (web app or local app. Might be easier to start with local)
* More advanced data history and analysis visualization options.

Some ideas
* Give goals to hit for the next workout based on the older one.
* Move-based analytics (though, if we use a database, this should be accessible rather easily.)
