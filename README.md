# ProgressiveOverload

## To Do

This is the current, simple requirements that needs to be dealt on the backend.

* Add a few types of exercises (and allow users to create some) - DONE
    * On a second thought, we might want to just use a predetermined number of exercises
* Keep a history of previous workout sets
    * Allow adding to history of sets - DONE
    * Allow adjusting and deleting history
* Create new exercise sets (Allow the adding any workout in it) and give it names
    * Need to allow people to give names to sets.
* Show exercise set trends.
    * Show line graphs of exercises. - DONE
    * Add trendlines.
    * Allow users to apply filters such as:
        * Exercises
        * Dates
* Add the function to create workouts and place sets within it.
    * Allow exercise specific graphs

Then...

* GUI (web app or local app. Might be easier to start with local)
* More advanced data history and analysis visualization options.

Some ideas
* Give goals to hit for the next workout based on the older one.
* Move-based analytics (though, if we use a database, this should be accessible rather easily.)
